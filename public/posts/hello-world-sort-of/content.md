HELLO WORLD: FIRST POST FROM AN APPLE IIE 

Well, that was about all I got typed out before the Apple IIe let out a large pop and magic smoke poured out. Looks like it was coming from the power supply- darn. I can't imagine breathing magic smoke gives me any superpowers, so I stepped away and added "fix IIe" to the ever-growing list of projects in the Tavus computer workshop.

A preface may be helpful at this point: I've been meaning to write about the things I care about and the journey in, well *caring* about them. Writing has always been difficult for me. Prioritization, time, distractions. When I'm on my MacBook it is too easy to drift into work or to consume instead of create.

Tangentially- we have a *lot* of old computers at Tavus- it's sort of our thing. We have immense amount of respect and curiosity for the history of computing and how we got here, but I'm going to save that for another post that I hope will actually be written on one of the many hopefully-not-broken machines we own.

I've also been wanting to immerse myself in these computers to do some hands-on learning. I am obsessed with the *why* behind products. Whether it is an old computer, a car, or a piece of art, products are tangible representations of the people who built them: how they felt, what they dreamed, what motivated them, and the environments they were created in. The constraints, the requirements, the priors. What better way to understand the evolution of computing than to use these machines as they were used---to see through the eyes of the people who created them and the people who depended on them. There is an appreciation you cannot get without that experience.

So my solve is to combine them. I'm going to do all my personal writing, whether it's about old computers, cars, design, Tavus or anything else on one of these vintage computers. Given word processing was the killer app for personal computers, it feels perfect.

With each post I'll also include information about the machine I intended to use, the journey in using it, and a score. The score is basically a reflection of how well the computer held up, how "au natural" I managed to stay, and how much I enjoyed using it. Given I've already succumbed to some brain rot, gamification might be the only way to trick myself into taking the more interesting (and probably hardest) path.

I'd like to note that this will not be super easy. I was born in 1997. Almost all the machines that I'll be using are older than me, and they don't exactly like to behave with their age. On top of that, the rule is no cheating with modern computers. The goal is to these machines (the earliest of which are from the 70s) to post *directly* to this website.

As you can see, I already failed. The Apple IIe went up in smoke, so this is being typed on a MacBook Pro. A fitting start. But this is the last* time. From here on out, all posts will be from one of the olds. Which also means this might be my only post.

**Ground Rules and Gamification**

These posts will be as raw as they come. What you read is exactly what was possible on the machine, with no editing or cleanup after the fact (unless something goes wrong). No formatting tricks, no polish, no LLM slop.

I'll generally start with the newer vintage machines and work my way backward in time. This will help me kickstart this endeavor and make it a habit, as well as make it more interesting and difficult as time goes on

To the extent that is doable, I will try to use modern machines as little as possible. Let's talk scoring:

Authenticity:
- -10 pts --- Completely failed and had to use my MacBook to write about my failure (exhibit A)
- 0 pts --- Post was written on the machine, then re-typed on a newer machine
- 5 pts --- Post was written on the machine, printed out, then re-typed on a newer machine
- 10 pts --- Post was written on the machine, then file transferred to a newer machine
- 20 pts --- Post was written and posted directly from the machine

Reliability:
- -10 pts --- Machine never worked at all
- -5 pts --- Machine broke during usage and couldn't be repaired in time to finish
- 5 pts --- Machine broke during usage, but I fixed it and finished the post
- 10 pts --- Machine was broken before, and I brought it back to life for the post
- 15 pts --- Machine worked perfectly the whole time

Hassaan's Score:

My review of the design, usability, and fun in actually using the machine. Completely subjective, 0-25 pts

Age Multiplier:

Final score ร (machine's age รท 10), so the older guys gets a fighting chance.

*Note: some lack of points awarded will be due to incompetence, laziness, or time, rather than what was actually possible.*
