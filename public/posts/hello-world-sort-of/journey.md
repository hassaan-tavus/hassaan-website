# The Journey

The journey to write *"Hello, World (Sort Of)"* began with a simple question: **what would it be like to create something meaningful on the technology of the past?**

## Acquiring the Machine

I acquired the Apple IIe from a collector who had lovingly restored it. The machine booted up with its characteristic:
- Whir of the cooling fan
- Click of the disk drive
- Warm green glow of the CRT display

## The Writing Process

The writing process was... challenging. The constraints included:
1. **40-column display** - constant line breaks
2. **No modern conveniences** - forced different thinking
3. **Deliberate keystrokes** - each one mattered

But there was something magical about the deliberate nature of it all.

> I wrote the first draft entirely on the Apple IIe, then transferred it via floppy disk to a modern system for final editing.

The **85% authenticity score** reflects this hybrid approach - the heart of the piece was born on vintage hardware, but some refinement happened in the digital age.

## The Failure

Unfortunately, the Apple IIe let out a large pop and magic smoke poured out during the writing process. This was a fitting start to the project - demonstrating the challenges of working with vintage hardware that's older than I am.

The machine failure actually became part of the story, highlighting the reality of working with 40+ year old technology. Sometimes the best stories come from the unexpected challenges.
