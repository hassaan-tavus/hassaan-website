## Machine History

I picked up this Apple IIe from an older gentleman who had originally bought it to run his restaurant business almost 40 years ago. The restaurant is still around today. He had not touched the computer in decades, yet it was in beautiful condition and powered right up like it had been waiting to be used again.

It also seems like his kids spent time on it too. The machine came with a small stack of games and some really cool Apple Joysticks. I am saving those for another post, but it was fun to imagine this computer pulling double duty invoices and schedules by day, games at night.

## Machine Review 
### Using the Machine
Getting it running was mostly straightforward, if a little slow. It came with AppleWriter 2.0 for ProDOS on a 5.25-inch floppy. At first I was fumbling, trying to boot into ProDOS and then launch AppleWriter through the OS. That only left me staring at the file structure. Eventually I realized you just run the disk directly. Once I did, the IIe came alive with the clattering, mechanical racket of the floppy drive. Every read and write sounds like something is breaking, but the noise is oddly satisfying.

When it finally loaded, I fell in love. Writing in AppleWriter is pure. There is nothing but you and the words, no formatting, no fonts, no distractions. Just text glowing across 40 columns. The keyboard is part of what makes it work. It is not the finest mechanical feel by modern standards, but it is springy and light in a way that makes you want to type faster and faster. It feels more like a typewriter than a computer.

My time was cut short when the machine eventually went up in smoke during use. Age always wins in the end. Even so, in that short window it gave me one of the most direct, stripped-down writing experiences I have ever had.

### Reflection
The Apple IIe was one of the first vintage machines I ever bought, so it holds a special place for me. Getting it directly from its original owner made it even more meaningful. For him it had been a work tool, something that kept his restaurant running. At the same time, it also carried memories of his kids playing games on it, with the worn floppies and chunky controllers still tucked in the box. That mix of work and play feels like the truest picture of what these early personal computers were.

Using the IIe today makes it clear how much we take for granted. This was once a revolution, a portal into computing at a simpler time. I can picture it sitting on a desk in the restaurant’s back office during the day, printing schedules and invoices, then later that night becoming the family’s game machine, loading up adventures one floppy at a time.
